#### Short Bio

Titanoboa is a Vyper interpreter offering features such as step-by-step debugging, gas profiling, pretty tracebacks, Jupyter notebook integration and blazingly fast speeds thanks to its highly optimized backend. Titanoboa allows Vyper developers to quickly prototype as well as thoroughly test their smart contracts.

## Impact statement

#### Describe your contribution(s) to Optimism 
_Please share the contributions you wish to receive RetroPGF for._

Titanoboa (boa) is an advanced toolkit for Vyper developers, offering rapid testing, prototyping, and features beyond Solidity frameworks. It enables comprehensive tests on smart contracts, including coverage reports, EVM state patching, and integration with pytest. Boa's opcode patching is crucial for testing across various EVM versions. Its highly optimized backend boosts testing speed, exemplified by Curve Finance reducing its test suite runtime to under a minute, thanks to Boa's embedded EVM eliminating slow RPC calls. Additionally, Boa's integration with Jupyter facilitates collaborative prototyping and complex transaction crafting. It's proven essential for Vyper developers on Optimism and Mainnet, enhancing network growth and security.
